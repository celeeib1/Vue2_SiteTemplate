            <p>Outcomes give important information (such as attendance numbers, change in knowledge, testimonials, and success tactics) that help us understand the impact and effectiveness of the programs we support. 
            It is a chance for your organization to share the success of your program. 
            It also verifies that the funding was used as described in the approved request. 
              You must complete an outcomes form for a program that was funded with a Patient Advocacy Grant (it is not required for Fundraising Charitable Grants). According to the executed LOA, if you do not complete the required outcomes 
              form, it may affect your organization’s eligibility for future grant support.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Once your program is done, you will get an email from our Grant Portal prompting you to complete the outcomes form</li>
            <li>You must complete the outcomes form in 45 calendar days.</li>

        According to the executed LOA, if you do not complete the required reconciliation form, it may affect your organization’s eligibility for future grant support.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>The reconciliation form must be completed within 45 calendar days after your program ends. In it, you will confirm that:
          <ul>
